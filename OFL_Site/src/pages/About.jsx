                        <p className="py-4">Philadelphia is a city of two rivers, linked to the Atlantic Ocean. Its history and culture are waterborne. Itâ€™s home to many â€” people Indigenous to the region, born-and-raised, transplants, and immigrants alike â€” who have deep ancestral and cultural connections with water and fish. Yet today, many Philly residents may feel disconnected from their waters, cultures, and foods. Fish can connect us to, and teach us about, all three.</p>
                        <p className="py-4">Our Fishing Log (OFL, pronounced awful - or awe-full? ðŸ˜‰) aims to explore, synthesize, and build community in Philly through fish. Itâ€™s a multimedia storytelling project, centered around a documentary podcast series. In addition to the podcast, we are sharing morsels of visual storytelling, hosting events, making a zine, and doing gyotaku (traditional Japanese fish printing) workshops with local youth.</p>

                <div className="px-24 bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-600 via-blue-500 to-yellow-600">
                    <p className="py-4">Each podcast episode traces a narrative arc through a different species of fish found in local waters, including freshwaters around Philadelphia and ocean waters in New Jersey and Delaware. We start by going fishing, and end by inviting a local home cook or chef to co-create and share a meal thatâ€™s meaningful to them. In between, we include conversations with a diverse lineup of anglers, scientists, culinary experts, conservationists, and stewards, plus exploratory interludes, lyrical reflections, and sonic pleasures.</p>
                    <p className="py-4">This project is a coming together of many minds, bodies, and hearts. feini yin is our lead reporter and project manager â€” youâ€™ll hear their voice on the podcast and, unless otherwise stated, you can assume theyâ€™re the one posting on our social media. Rowhome Productions is producing our podcast. Neal Santos is our lead visual storyteller. Fishadelphia is our community partner. You can read more about the many amazing project contributors on our collaborators page.</p>
